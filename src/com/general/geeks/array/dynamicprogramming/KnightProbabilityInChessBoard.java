/**
 * 
 * On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and
 * attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the
 * top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
 * 
 * A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each
 * move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal
 * direction.
 * 
 * 
 * Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves
 * uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves
 * there.
 * 
 * The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved
 * off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the
 * board after it has stopped moving.
 * 
 * Example: Input: 3, 2, 0, 0 Output: 0.0625 Explanation: There are two moves
 * (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board. From each of those
 * positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
 * The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625. Note: N will
 * be between 1 and 25. K will be between 0 and 100. The knight always initially
 * starts on the board.
