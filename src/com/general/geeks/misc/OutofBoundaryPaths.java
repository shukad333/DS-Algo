 * There is an m by n grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate (i,j) of the
 * ball, you can move the ball to adjacent cell or cross the grid boundary in
 * four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can at most move N
 * times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary.
 * The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
