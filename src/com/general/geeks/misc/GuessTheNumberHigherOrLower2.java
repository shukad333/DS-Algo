/**
 * 
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * 
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
 * higher or lower.
 * 
 * However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
 * $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * n = 10, I pick 8.
 * 
 * First round: You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5. Second
 * round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7. Third round: You
 * guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 * 
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 * 
 * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21. Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how
 * much money you need to have to guarantee a win
