/**
 * A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array board. Return True if and only
 * if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid
 * tic-tac-toe game.
 * 
 * The board is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters " ", "X", and "O". The
 * " " character represents an empty square.
 * 
 * Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
 * 
 * Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" "). The first
 * player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places
 * "O" characters. "X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares,
 * never filled ones. The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty)
 * character filling any row, column, or diagonal. The game also ends if all
 * squares are non-empty. No more moves can be played if the game is over.
 * Example 1: Input: board = ["O ", " ", " "] Output: false Explanation: The
 * first player always plays "X".
 * 
 * Example 2: Input: board = ["XOX", " X ", " "] Output: false Explanation:
 * Players take turns making moves.
 * 
 * Example 3: Input: board = ["XXX", " ", "OOO"] Output: false
 * 
 * Example 4: Input: board = ["XOX", "O O", "XOX"] Output: true Note:
 * 
 * board is a length-3 array of strings, where each string board[i] has length
 * 3. Each board[i][j] is a character in the set {" ", "X", "O"}.
